# Roadmap

Future work, ordered by priority within each section. Open an issue or PR if you want to push something up the list.

## Auth

- **OAuth / AAD authentication.** Currently NavUserPassword only. OAuth unlocks BC Online (SaaS) and modern on-prem deployments. Largest gap.
- **Windows authentication.** For domain-joined on-prem deployments where NavUserPassword is not enabled.

## Install ergonomics

- **Cursor support.** Add an "Install in Cursor" badge and a manual `~/.cursor/mcp.json` snippet to the README.
- **Interactive setup wizard.** `npx business-central-mcp init` that detects which host(s) are installed (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VSCode, Cursor), prompts for BC URL/user/password, and writes the config files directly.
- **Host auto-detection inside the wizard.** Per-OS path detection for the four hosts above.

## Protocol

- **More tools.** Cover the remaining ~10% of the web client that the current 12 tools do not. Tracked via issues.
- **BC29+ wire-compat verification.** Verify each new BC version as it ships.

## Distribution

- **Sign the `.dxt`.** Once Claude Desktop's signing requirements stabilize, sign the artifact in the release workflow.
- **MCP marketplace.** Publish to whatever official extension index emerges (Claude's, VSCode's, generic MCP registry).
